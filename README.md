### The present project has been created in the context of the course "3,793 | 4,799: Skills: Programming - Introduction Level" by 2 HSG students

## The project is composed of the following files:
* 1 HTML file (index.html) which contains the website structure & content
* 1 CSS file (style.css) which defines the appearance of the HTML items
* 1 JavaScript (apps.js) which contains the code supporting the dynamic functionality 
* 2 third-party code files (particles.js & particlesjs-config.json) which support the interactive particules landing page background (from https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/)

## Necessary libraries

* https://scrollmagic.io/ (with plugin https://scrollmagic.io/docs/debug.addIndicators.html

## My Dynamic CV Website
* The purpose of this project is to offer an alternative to our traditional static resume (curriculum vitae).
* Using HTML, CSS & JavaScript, we built a template to present our profile more dynamically with the following sections:
1) A landing page with interactive animated particles
2) An about section
3) A slider featuring education credentials
4) A skills & certifications section
5) An animated experience tree 

**Since this project is constructed as a template, it can filled with one's actual information and redesigned according to one's tastes before being hosted online as a alternative/ complementary resume.**
